## 1. What is a Promise?

**Definition:**  

In JavaScript, a Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. 

**Key Points:**  

**States:**

A promise can be in one of three states:

Pending: The initial state, where the operation has not completed yet.

Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and the promise now holds a resulting value.

Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise now holds a reason for the failure (usually an error object).

**Chaining:**

Promises allow you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together in a readable way using .then() and .catch().

**Asynchronous Operations:**

**Promises are commonly used with asynchronous operations like fetching data from an API, reading files, or performing time-consuming calculations.
